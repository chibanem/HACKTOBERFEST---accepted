Puppeteer (Aka Headless Chrome Browser for Automation) :
Puppeteer is a Node.js library that offers a simple but efficient API that enables you to control Googleâ€™s Chrome or Chromium browser.
It also enables you to run Chromium in headless mode (useful for running browsers in servers) and can send and receive requests without the need for a user interface.
The great thing is that it works in the background, performing actions as instructed by the API.
